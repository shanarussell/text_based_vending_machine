Capstone project #1 for Merit America program

This was our my capstone project for the Merit America java development boot camp. With the assistance of my pair programming partner, we created this command line vending machine based on the requirements given to us by the MA program. You will find those requirements in the ReadMe document that's located in the "capstone" folder. We completed all of the requirements as well as the bonus requirements and presented our work via Zoom to an audience of 20 other classmates as well our professional and technical coaches.
